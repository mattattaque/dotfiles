# Shameless copy of @michaeljsmalley's script adapted to my own needs.
# Basically, script creates dir and dumps all old dotfiles into it.
# Next, creates symlinks in $HOME to the dotfiles you have in ~/dotfiles
# Run with 'bash make.sh'



# There's a problem with symlinking to .vim, and .oh-my-zsh, you have to create those manually, 
# not sure why yet.
