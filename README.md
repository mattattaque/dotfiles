#Matthew's dotfiles




Here I present my dotfiles that make all my favorite programs tick to my liking. 


###Vim
The .vimrc works in conjunction with [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), so first.. 

pull down vundle...
```
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/
```
then go into vim and run

```
:BundleInstall
```

to pull down all them sexy vim plugins 

###Zsh
After installing zed shell, clone [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) into your home directory. 
```
git clone https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-myzsh
```




##Enjoy!
